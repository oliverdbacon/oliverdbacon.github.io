					Outside of music, I go by Oliver Bacon. I currently live in Tacoma WA, and attened the University of Puget Sound. I am a computer science student and intend on majoring in artificial intelligence. Other than making music I enjoy relaxing and working on projects. I have a facination with oscilloscopes, and I own a <a href="https://imgur.com/AeiSW2t" style=" text-decoration: none; color: #2F2F2F"><b>760a Tektronix Vectorscope</b></a>. I also really enjoy cars. I drive a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/P8N21Z7" style=" text-decoration: none; color: #2F2F2F"><b>1992 Subaru SVX</b></a> which has made an apperence in the canvas on "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1kVFcceqkmxGAHDcg5RfKs?si=917811b928bc430b" style=" text-decoration: none; color: #2F2F2F"><b>Right Now</b></a>" on my EP "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5EsWVE0PFOiiopCwaEQ43V?si=e3VwB_pYTIqfVJUMqTyaDg" style=" text-decoration: none; color: #2F2F2F"><b>Mirror</b></a>" and also a few of my earliest albums that can be found on my Soundcloud.

					Throughout my life I have always enjoyed making music. I took piano lessons when I was 7 and learned how to record and use Garage Band to make tunes. I eventally retired from Garage Band to use Fl Studio in highschool. I still use Fl for the majority of my work. I have only ever collaborated with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/04cYIDA2ukgyzmSbsa6ujc?si=cr0SuXvoS9yN8lGqvzEMMA" style=" text-decoration: none; color: #2F2F2F"><b>WhoCreatedUs?</b></a> but I plan on doing more collaborations in the future. If you are interested in collborating check out my <a href="business.html" style=" text-decoration: none; color: #2F2F2F"><b>Business Inquirys</b></a> page.

					To catch up on what I am doing, make sure to follow my socials! I post WIP tunes on my YouTube and update my Instagram whenever I have an upcoming release. Wether you are just stopping by, or you have been a fan, I really appreciate you for listening to my music. It's what I'm passionate about, and knowing that just one person enjoys listening makes me happy.
